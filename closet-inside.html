            <br><br>&emsp; you are the main character and your best friend leon is in love with you, maybe in a dangerous way
            <br><br>&emsp; this art of leon on this page here is my favorite out of all the art i worked on for this assignment!
            <br><br>&emsp; this was actually my first time trying out animation and i used 3-4 frames for each animation. 
            <br><br>&emsp; thank you for playing through my HTML + CSS game and i hope you enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed creating it!
